Pooling-Object-Manager-for-UNITY
======================
basically a script for creating **object pools** 
so you dont have to instantiate objects on the fly  (like projectiles!) 
which creates lag and stuff.
================================
Updated to 2.0! (after 5 years!)

refactored to a much simpler script to implement
with far more cleaner code.
